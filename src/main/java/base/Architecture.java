    Nya is for exchanging thoughts, knowledge and things.
    
    We are not sure if all this data should be kept forever,
    but we are certain that it should change people forever.
    
    
    == Exchange ==
    Services and assets:
        + user messages/channels
        + coins
        + files
        + freelance
        + hardware rental
    
    
    == Addresses ==
    Mark different resources:
        $ coin
        # channel
        @ user
        / command
    
    
    == Commands ==
    Actions that take place through the command line
        JOIN join a channel
        STATUS user profile status
        MESSAGE send a message to another user
        CLEAR clear the screen
        CD/RMDIR/MKDIR/RENAME file operations
        SEND send a message/file/coin to another user
        PLAY listen to a playlist from a channel
    
    
    == User interfaces ==
    
    NYA is expected to run across the CLI, Web UI, normal GUI apps and API.
    Preference is given to the command line interface and API, permitting
    to integrate services to platforms such as Telegram, Twitter and IRC.
    
    For example on twitter:
        @nyaplay SEND 2 $NIA to @user123     // send money to another user
    
    Seeing a channel through the web browser:
        https://nya.link/#chill-out
    
    Should play music as seen on:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dozL3WmYBs8
